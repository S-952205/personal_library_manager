The Personal Library Manager is a Python-based command-line application designed to help users organize and track their book collections efficiently. This tool allows users to add new books, remove existing entries, search for specific titles or authors, and update book details such as reading status. It calculates reading progress by displaying the percentage of completed books relative to the total collection. Data persistence is ensured through file storage, enabling users to save and reload their library information between sessions. The application runs in an interactive loop, presenting a user-friendly menu that guides navigation, making it accessible for both casual readers and avid book enthusiasts.
